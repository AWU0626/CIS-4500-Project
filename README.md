Description:

The goal of our project is to provide users (parents in particular) looking to buy a home a way to search for schools, neighborhoods, and houses that fit their needs. Specifically, we want to provide access to insights from educational data in addition to information about relevant housing.

We do this by drawing on data about houses, education attainment levels, and schools to recommend users homes and places that suit their needs. We understand that users come in with a variety of different starting points, so we offer different ways to search with varying levels of specificity and with different priorities.
